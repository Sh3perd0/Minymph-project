# Minymph Project

**A Pokémon-inspired Java project**

---

Welcome to my personnal Minymph Project! This project is a Pokémon-inspired game developed in Java, because I had time. Below you'll find the last update that I did on the project, and instructions to run the project.

## Last update
**Not Finished**

I only have implemented the combat feature of the game. It is still not finished, since I need to add other features such as accuracy of the moves, and also the most important thing: the enemy bot behaviour that you will fight.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java JDK**
- **Javac** (Java compiler)
